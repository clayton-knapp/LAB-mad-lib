                    Now, this is a story all about how <br>
                    My life got flipped-turned <span id="word1">upside down</span><br>
                    And I liked to take a minute<br>
                    Just sit right there<br>
                    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called <span id="word2">Bel Air</span><br>
                    <br>
                    In west <span id="word3">Philadelphia</span> born and raised<br>
                    On the playground was where I spent most of my <span id=word4>days</span><br>
                    Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
                    And all shootin some b-ball outside of the <span id="word5">school</span><br>
                    When a couple of guys<br>
                    Who were up to no good<br>
                    Startin making trouble in my <span id="word6">neighborhood</span><br>
                    I got in one little fight and my <span id="word7">mom</span> got scared<br>
                    She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in <span id="word8">Bel Air</span>'<br>
                    <br>
                    <!-- I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br>
                    But she packed my suite case and send me on my way<br>
                    She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.<br>
                    I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.<br>
                    <br>
                    First class, yo this is bad<br>
                    Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.<br>
                    Is this what the people of Bel-Air Living like?<br>
                    Hmmmmm this might be alright.<br>
                    <br>
                    But wait I hear there're prissy, wine all that<br>
                    Is Bel-Air the type of place they send this cool cat?<br>
                    I don't think sow<br>
                    I'll see when I get there<br>
                    I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
                    
                    Well, the plane landed and when I came out
                    There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
                    I ain't trying to get arrested
                    I just got here
                    I sprang with the quickness like lightening, disappeared
                    
                    I whistled for a cab and when it came near
                    The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
                    If anything I can say this cab is rare
                    But I thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'
                    -->
                    I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
                    And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes <span id="word9">smell</span> ya later'<br>
                    I looked at my kingdom<br>
                    I was finally there<br>
                    To sit on my throne as the <span id="word10">Prince</span> of Bel Air<br>
                </p>
